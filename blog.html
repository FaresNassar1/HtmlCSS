            WellBeing International (WBI) believes that providing access to
            appropriate resources helps to inform people about the choices they
            can make that will have a positive impact on not just themselves and
            their families, but also for animals and the environment. WBI’s
            Global Awareness strategy consists of three major components: the
            WellBeing International Studies Repository, WBI’s Website and our
            Direct Outreach via our newsletters (WellBeing News and Tales of
            WellBeing) and our social media pages. The newsletters translate
            current scientific knowledge into crisp, clear and readable articles
            that cover a broad range of issues addressing the interactions among
            people, animals and the environment (the PAE triad).
